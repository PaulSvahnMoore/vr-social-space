  <h1>Privacy Policy for VR Social Space (VRSS)</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 18, 2025</p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy applies to VR Social Space (VRSS), a product of <strong>Sangeki Entertainment</strong>, based in Sweden.</p>

  <p>We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your information. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data in our free social VR experience available on the Meta Quest platform, in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable laws.</p>

  <p>By using VRSS, you agree to the practices described below.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

  <p>We strive to minimize the personal data we collect. However, due to the multiplayer nature of the app and integration with third-party services, the following information may be processed:</p>

  <h3>1.1 Automatically Collected (Anonymized) Data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Device type (e.g., Meta Quest model)</li>
    <li>App version</li>
    <li>Session duration, connection logs, and crash reports</li>
    <li>General gameplay telemetry (for debugging or improvement purposes)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.2 Voice Data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Voice chat is enabled through Photon Voice.</li>
    <li>Voice is transmitted in real-time and is not recorded or stored by VRSS.</li>
    <li>Photon Voice processes audio to facilitate live communication but does not retain it after transmission.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.3 Avatar & Meta Account Data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>VRSS uses Meta Avatars and Meta’s SDKs.</li>
    <li>Avatar appearance and preferences are handled by Meta and may reflect your Meta account settings.</li>
    <li>We do not collect or store Meta account or avatar data directly — it is managed by Meta.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use the Information</h2>
  <p>We use collected data solely to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide multiplayer functionality</li>
    <li>Enable voice communication between users</li>
    <li>Render avatars and user presence via Meta SDKs</li>
    <li>Monitor app performance and fix bugs</li>
    <li>Improve user experience</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not use your data for advertising, profiling, or monetization.</p>

  <h2>3. User-Generated Content</h2>
  <p>When using VRSS, users can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Communicate via voice</li>
    <li>Interact using Meta avatars</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All user-generated content (e.g., what you say or do in VR) is transient and processed for real-time gameplay only. However, we are not responsible for how other users interact or behave within the app.</p>
  <p>Please use the app responsibly and respectfully.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>VRSS relies on the following third-party services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://dashboard.photonengine.com/account/privacyandcookiepolicy" target="_blank">Photon Engine (Fusion & Voice)</a> – for multiplayer networking and voice communication</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.meta.com/legal/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Meta Avatars & Meta SDKs</a> – for identity, avatar rendering, and Quest platform integration</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These services may process limited information necessary to enable their features. Please refer to their privacy policies for full details.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, rent, or share any user data with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.</p>
  <p>Data is only shared with third-party services strictly to enable core features like networking, voice, and avatars.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable measures to protect any data processed through VRSS. Any data handled (like logs or diagnostics) is anonymized and secured. Voice data is not stored.</p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>VRSS is not intended for users under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has used VRSS without your consent, please contact us so we can delete any associated data.</p>

  <h2>8. Your Rights Under GDPR</h2>
  <p>If you are located in the European Union (including Sweden), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grants you certain rights regarding your personal data. You have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access the personal data we may hold about you</li>

    <li>Restrict or object to how your data is processed</li>
    <li>Withdraw your consent (if data processing is based on consent)</li>
    <li>Request data portability (to receive your data in a usable format)</li>
    <li>Lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Your data is processed on the following legal bases: to provide the app and its features (performance of a contract), to improve the app (legitimate interests), and to comply with legal obligations.</p>

  <p>If you believe your rights have been violated, you may lodge a complaint with the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY): <a href="https://www.imy.se" target="_blank">https://www.imy.se</a></p>
